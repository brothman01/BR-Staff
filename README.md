# BR-Staff
This plugin began as something I found myself writing for clients so I adapted it somewhat and here it is.  I will add new features in the future.

To use this plugin install/activate it then look for the 'Staff' button that will now be on the dashboard.

To add a new staff member, just add a new Staff member post and fill out the bibliographic fields.

To add a staff member to the front end, just copy the short code in the 'Shortcode' column of the post table from the staff member you want to add and paste it on any page.  When a user visits the website they will see the staff member as you filled it out in the dashboard.
